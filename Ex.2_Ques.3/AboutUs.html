<h2>Online food ordering is the process of ordering food through the restaurant's</h2>
<h2>own website or mobile app, or through a multi-restaurant's website or app. A</h2>
<h2>customer can choose to have the food delivered or for pick-up. The process consists</h2>
<h2>of a customer choosing the restaurant of their choice, scanning the menu items, choosing</h2>
<h2>an item, and finally choosing for pick-up or delivery. Payment is then administered by</h2>
<h2>paying with a credit card or debit card through the app or website or in cash at the restaurant</h2>
<h2>when going to pickup. The website and app inform the customer of the food quality, duration of</h2>
<h2>food preparation, and when the food is ready for pick-up or the amount of time it will take for delivery.</h2>
<h2>The online food ordering market has increased in the U.S with 40 percent of U.S adults having ordered</h2>
<h2>their food online once. The online food ordering market includes foods prepared by restaurants, prepared</h2>
<h2>by independent people, and groceries being ordered online and then picked up or delivered.</h2>
