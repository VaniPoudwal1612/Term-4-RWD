<h2>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. It is</h2>
<h2>usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates,</h2>
<h2>fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated</h2>
<h2>by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Historically,</h2>
<h2>humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, the majority</h2>
<h2>of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food</h2>
<h2>industry. Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for</h2>
<h2>Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization,</h2>
<h2>and International Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity,</h2>
<h2>climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.</h2>
<h2>The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural</h2>
<h2>Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well</h2>
<h2>as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger".</h2>
