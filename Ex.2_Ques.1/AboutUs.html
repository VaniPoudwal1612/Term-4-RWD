<h2>Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent.</h2>
<h2>The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective,</h2>
<h2>early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function;</h2>
<h2>health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease.</h2>
<h2>An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic,</h2>
<h2>and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles;</h2>
<h2>ability to deal with physical, biological, psychological, and social stress".</h2>
<h2>Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO)</h2>
<h2>proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to well-being, in terms of "physical, mental,</h2>
<h2>and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".</h2>
<h2>Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague,</h2>
<h2>excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal</h2>
<h2>and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model.</h2>
